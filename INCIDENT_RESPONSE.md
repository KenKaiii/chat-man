## Incident Response Phases

### Phase 1: Detection and Analysis

#### Detection Sources

1. **Automated Alerts**
```bash
# Check security alerts
curl http://localhost:3001/api/security/alerts?resolved=false | jq
```

2. **Audit Log Monitoring**
```bash
# Review recent critical events
grep "CRITICAL" data/audit/audit.log | tail -n 50 | jq
```

3. **System Health Checks**
```bash
# Check system health
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health/detailed | jq
```

4. **User Reports**
- Suspicious activity notifications
- Access issues
- Unusual system behavior

#### Initial Analysis Checklist

- [ ] What happened? (Event description)
- [ ] When did it happen? (Timestamp)
- [ ] What systems are affected?
- [ ] Is the incident still ongoing?
- [ ] What is the initial severity assessment?
- [ ] Has data been compromised?
- [ ] Who detected the incident?

#### Evidence Collection

**DO NOT modify production systems during evidence collection**

1. **Capture Security Alerts**
```bash
mkdir -p incident-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)/evidence
cd incident-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)/evidence

curl http://localhost:3001/api/security/alerts > security-alerts.json
```

2. **Export Audit Logs**
```bash
cp data/audit/audit.log audit-log-backup.log
curl http://localhost:3001/api/audit/export > audit-export.json
```

3. **Capture System State**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health/detailed > system-health.json
curl http://localhost:3001/api/metrics > system-metrics.json
ps aux > process-list.txt
netstat -tuln > network-connections.txt
```

4. **Capture Configuration**
```bash
cp config/settings.json config-backup.json
ls -laR config/ > config-permissions.txt
md5sum config/.auth config/.encryption_salt > config-checksums.txt
```

### Phase 2: Containment

#### Short-term Containment

**For Data Breach (Level 1)**:

1. **Immediate Actions**
```bash
# Stop the service IMMEDIATELY
sudo systemctl stop chatman
# OR
pm2 stop chatman
```

2. **Isolate System**
```bash
# Block external access at firewall
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 3001 -j DROP

# OR disable in reverse proxy
sudo systemctl stop nginx
```

3. **Preserve Evidence**
```bash
# Create forensic backup
sudo dd if=/dev/sda of=/mnt/forensics/disk-image-$(date +%Y%m%d).img bs=4M

# Backup database
cp data/sessions.db incident-evidence/sessions-$(date +%Y%m%d).db
```

**For Brute Force Attack (Level 2)**:

1. **Identify Attack Source**
```bash
# Find failed login attempts
grep "AUTH_LOGIN_FAILED" data/audit/audit.log | jq '.details.ip' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

2. **Block Attacker IPs**
```bash
# At firewall level
sudo iptables -A INPUT -s <attacker-ip> -j DROP

# OR in nginx
echo "deny <attacker-ip>;" >> /etc/nginx/conf.d/blocked-ips.conf
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

3. **Force Password Reset**
```bash
# Generate new strong password
NEW_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 24)
export CHAT_MAN_PASSWORD="$NEW_PASSWORD"
bun run server/auth/setup.ts
```

**For Backup Compromise (Level 2)**:

1. **Verify All Backups**
```bash
# Check all backup integrity
for backup in data/backups/*.backup; do
  BACKUP_ID=$(basename $backup .backup)
  echo "Verifying: $BACKUP_ID"
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/backup/verify/$BACKUP_ID
done
```

2. **Isolate Backup Directory**
```bash
# Change permissions to prevent access
chmod 000 data/backups/
```

3. **Create Forensic Copy**
```bash
cp -r data/backups/ /mnt/forensics/backups-$(date +%Y%m%d)/
```

#### Long-term Containment

**Patch and Update**:
```bash
# Update system packages
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Update application dependencies
bun update

# Rebuild application
bun run build
```

**Enhanced Monitoring**:
```bash
# Reduce monitoring interval temporarily
# Edit config/settings.json
"monitoring": {
  "checkIntervalMinutes": 1  // Increased frequency during incident
}
```

**Additional Access Controls**:
- Implement IP whitelisting
- Add VPN requirement
- Enable 2FA (if available)
- Rotate all credentials

### Phase 3: Eradication

#### Remove Threat

**For Malware/Backdoor**:
1. Scan system for malware
2. Remove malicious files
3. Verify system integrity
4. Reinstall from clean source if necessary

**For Compromised Credentials**:
```bash
# Rotate all credentials
NEW_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 24)
export CHAT_MAN_PASSWORD="$NEW_PASSWORD"
bun run server/auth/setup.ts

# Rotate encryption keys
openssl rand -base64 32 > config/.encryption_salt.new
# Re-encrypt data (requires custom script)
mv config/.encryption_salt.new config/.encryption_salt
```

**For Configuration Vulnerability**:
```bash
# Review and update settings
vim config/settings.json

# Verify secure permissions
chmod 700 config/
chmod 600 config/.auth config/.encryption_salt
chmod 644 config/settings.json
```

#### Verify Eradication

- [ ] Threat no longer present in system
- [ ] All malicious artifacts removed
- [ ] Security controls functioning
- [ ] No unusual system behavior
- [ ] Clean malware scan

### Phase 4: Recovery

#### Restore Services

1. **Verify System Integrity**
```bash
# Check system health
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health/detailed | jq

# Verify no security alerts
curl http://localhost:3001/api/security/alerts?resolved=false | jq
```

2. **Test with Limited Access**
```bash
# Start service in maintenance mode
# Test core functionality
# Verify authentication works
# Check data integrity
```

3. **Restore from Backup if Necessary**
```bash
# List available backups
curl http://localhost:3001/api/backup/list | jq

# Test restore first
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/backup/test-restore/<backup-id>

# If test successful, restore
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/backup/restore/<backup-id>
```

4. **Gradual Service Restoration**
```bash
# Enable service
sudo systemctl start chatman

# Monitor closely
journalctl -u chatman -f

# Re-enable external access
sudo iptables -D INPUT -p tcp --dport 3001 -j DROP
sudo systemctl start nginx
```

5. **Verify Operations**
- [ ] Authentication working
- [ ] Data accessible
- [ ] Backup system operational
- [ ] Audit logging functioning
- [ ] Monitoring active
- [ ] No errors in logs

#### Enhanced Monitoring Post-Recovery

```bash
# Increase monitoring frequency temporarily
# Monitor for 72 hours after restoration
# Review security alerts every 4 hours
# Check audit logs every 8 hours
```
